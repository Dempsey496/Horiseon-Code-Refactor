# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

I started off by adding ALT tags to all of the images on the Hoiseon website. This was very simple as I just had to add alt= and a description of the image in the code.

I Cleaned up span tag in H1. I simply moved the class tag out of the middle of the H1.

I changed div tags to more semantic tags to make organization easier. I changed divs into navs, headers, footers, and asides. After which I had to make the same changes to related css classes.

I consolidated much of the css code as much of it was the same, just labeled differently.

I added a CSS reset in order to ensure all browsers will view the website the same.

Took height out of article content so the text fits better, text will also not overflow when window is minimized.

Created new IDs for the navigation bar, I created three different IDs for the three sections of content. If the page is minimized the ID links will still take you exactly to the content you are clicking on (before all links in the nav bar directed you to the same spot on the page).
