# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

I started off by adding ALT tags to all of the images on the Hoiseon website. This was very simple as I just had to add alt= and a description of the image in the code.

I Cleaned up span tag in H1. I simply moved the class tag out of the middle of the H1.

I changed div tags to more semantic tags to make organization easier. Changed divs into navs, headers, footers, and asides. After which I had to make the same changes to related css classes.

I consolidated much of the css code as much of it was the same, just labeled differently.

Took height out of article content so the text fits better, text will also not overflow when window is smaller.

WORK ON NAV BAR!!!!
